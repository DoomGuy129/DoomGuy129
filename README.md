Hello and welcome, this is my Personal Github. All programs here are education assignments for both the Cert III I did in 2018-2019 
and Diploma of Software Development I'm currently doing. 

In the future, this will used for amateur to semi-professional projects. Namely Gamedev and learning Lower Level Programing.

If you are interested in Open Source contributions for my personal project, Dm and I'll evaluate your code.
As long as your code has a Permissive License, is well structured and is not pain to read. I'm fine.
So It would be advised that you change any GPL code to a LGPL equivalent.

Lastly, for communications, there is no code of conduct beyond a mutual agreement to just respect eachother and critique wisely.
Zealous Activism of anykind or Witchhunting is discouraged.
